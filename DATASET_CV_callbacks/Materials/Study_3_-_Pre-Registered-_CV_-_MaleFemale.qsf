You will not be directly identified in any publication or report of the study. But, some journal representatives may need access to your Personal Information to verify the study results and ensure the research meets the journal\u2019s quality standards. Also, journals may require that certain data from the study that does not directly identify you (i.e., de-identified survey responses) be made available to other researchers for further research projects. Improve the quality, design and safety of this study and other research studies. Conduct additional studies with the data collected in this study to advance scientific research and public health. At this time, we do not know the specific details of these future research projects. If your Personal Information is used for additional studies, specific safeguards will be used to protect the data, which may include: Using only information from which your direct identifiers have been removed instead of information that readily identifies you. Limiting access to specific individuals who are obligated to keep the information confidential. Using security measures to avoid data loss and unauthorized access. Anonymizing the data by destroying the link between the information and your personal identifiers. When required by applicable law, ensuring that the scientific research has the approval of IECs, IRBs, or other similar review groups.
