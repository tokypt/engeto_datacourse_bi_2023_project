Your Personal Information will be treated in compliance with applicable data protection laws. Exeter is the controller of your Personal Information collected for this study. Exeter and some of the other people using your Personal Information may be based in countries other than your country, including the United States. The European Commission has determined that the data protection laws of the United States do not protect personal information to the same extent as those of the European Economic Area.&nbsp; By signing this consent form, you consent to the transfer of your information to the U.S. The invesitgator and those working with the investigator will take steps to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information.<br>\nThe IRB(s) and IEC(s), Exeter will obtain and use your Personal Information to conduct and manage this study, and to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, including to: provide you with reimbursement, if allowed by the study, for your time, effort and certain expenses related to your participation; verify that the study is conducted correctly and that study data are accurate; answer questions from IRB(s), IEC(s), or government or regulatory agencies; contact you during and after the study (if necessary); and answer your data protection requests (if any).<br>\nYour Personal Information may also be used by the individuals and groups listed above to: Publish summaries of the study results in academic journals, on the internet or at educational meetings of other researchers. You will not be directly identified in any publication or report of the study. But, some journal representatives may need access to your Personal Information to verify the study results and ensure the research meets the journal\u2019s quality standards. Also, journals may require that certain data from the study that does not directly identify you (i.e., de-identified survey responses) be made available to other researchers for further research projects. Improve the quality, design and safety of this study and other research studies. Conduct additional studies with the data collected in this study to advance scientific research and public health. At this time, we do not know the specific details of these future research projects. If your Personal Information is used for additional studies, specific safeguards will be used to protect the data, which may include: Using only information from which your direct identifiers have been removed instead of information that readily identifies you. Limiting access to specific individuals who are obligated to keep the information confidential. Using security measures to avoid data loss and unauthorized access. Anonymizing the data by destroying the link between the information and your personal identifiers. When required by applicable law, ensuring that the scientific research has the approval of IECs, IRBs, or other similar review groups. The researchers will retain your Personal Information (including your Coded Information) for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this informed consent form, unless a different retention period is required or permitted by law.

Before the Study Site transfers your Personal Information, the Study Site will replace your name with a unique code and remove information that directly identifies you.
